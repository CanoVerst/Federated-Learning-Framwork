    # This is one important parameter that
    # may lead the failure of the loss criterion part
    # if your loss criterion relies on the batch_size
    # as its argument. For example, the NT_Xent loss utilized
    # by the SimCLR method set the defined batch_size as the parameter.
    # However, at the end of one epoch, the left samples may smaller than
    # the batch_size. This makes the #loaded samples != batch_size.
    # Working on criterion that is defined with batch_size but receives loaded
    # samples whose size is smaller than the batch size may causes problems.
    # drop_last = True can alleviate this issue.
    # Currently drop_last is default to be False in Plato.
    # Under this case, to avoid this issue, we need to set:
